# Portfolio Website for Lakhan Sharma

This project is a **custom portfolio website built for my client, Lakhan Sharma**, showcasing his skills, projects, and professional experience.  
It demonstrates my ability to create **modern, responsive, and interactive web applications**.

## Why This Portfolio Stands Out
- Designed **specifically for Lakhan Sharma**, tailored to his brand and skills  
- Modern, **minimalistic, and responsive UI** for desktop and mobile  
- Interactive elements like **floating skill tags, animations, and smooth transitions**  
- Perfect for **showcasing projects and attracting clients or employers**

## Key Features
- Fully responsive design for **all devices**  
- Interactive **skill tags** with hover effects  
- **Project showcase** with live links and GitHub integration  
- Smooth **scroll animations** for engaging user experience  
- **Contact section** with email, phone, and LinkedIn links
